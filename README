Device-LaCrosse-WS23xx version 0.08
===================================

Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx provides a simple interface for reading data
from La Crosse Technology WS-2300 series weather stations.  It is
based on the Open2300 project, but differs in several respects:

* Simplicity: the interface is simple and intuitive.  For hackers, the
  Tied interface makes it easy to visualize the address space.  And
  you don't have to do any of the nybble shifting or masking: it's all
  done for you.

* Versatility: read the values you want, in the units you want.  Write
  a script that logs only the values you're interested in.

* Caching: to minimize communication errors, Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx
  reads large blocks and caches them for a few seconds.

* Debugging: the La Crosse units don't always communicate too
  reliably.  Use the trace option to log serial I/O and track down
  problems.

Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx is intended for Perl hackers who
want a simple way to talk to their La Crosse weather station.
It could also be useful for non-Perl-types who want a simple
way to explore their devices.

Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx is standalone; it does not require Open2300.
